# The disc

## The disc

The retail DVD is encrypted and
[lindberghrecomp does not decrypt it](https://github.com/sp00nznet/lindberghrecomp/blob/master/docs/disc-format.md) —
the dump carves to named payload files and every one is ciphertext under a key
that lives in the cabinet. Bring a game tree you can already read; arcade
preservation projects have published clean dumps of many Lindbergh titles,
taken from original DVDs and cabinet hard discs by people who had the keys.
A clean tree looks like this:

```
disk0/
  lgj_final              the game (this is the ELF)
  game                   the launcher script
  lgjrc                  its config
  data/                  ADX/AIX audio, CSB banks, .xaf sound banks
  shader/Cg  extraShader/Cg
  libCg.so  libCgGL.so  libCgFX.so  libpng.so  libxerces-c.so
```

Those `.so` files are themselves 32-bit x86 ELFs with symbols — `libCg.so` has
284 functions, `libxerces-c.so` has 9,010 — so the 20 Cg and Xerces imports do
not need reimplementing either. They can go through the same pipeline.
