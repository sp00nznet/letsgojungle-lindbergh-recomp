/*
 * host.c - run recompiled Let's Go Jungle.
 *
 * There is very little to do here, and that is the point. The runtime maps the
 * game where it was linked and builds the stack the kernel would have; the
 * lifted code is the game. This just hands control over at the ELF's entry
 * point and gets out of the way.
 *
 * Everything the game reaches for that is not its own code - libc, OpenGL,
 * sound, the JVS I/O board - arrives as hle_call(), and the handlers live in
 * hle_*.c next to this file. A handler that is missing aborts naming itself,
 * so the way to work on this port is to run it and read what it asks for.
